2 137                         Enter Chorus.
2 138 
2 139 
2 140   Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
2 141     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
2 142     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
2 143     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
2 144     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
2 145     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
2 146     Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
2 147     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
2 148     The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
2 149     And the continuance of their parents' rage,
2 150     Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
2 151     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
2 152     The which if you with patient ears attend,
2 153     What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
2 154                                                          [Exit.]

2 159 ACT I. Scene I.
2 160 Verona. A public place.
2 161 
2 162 Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
2 163 of Capulet.
2 164 
2 165 
2 166   Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
2 167 
2 168   Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
2 169 
2 170   Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
2 171 
2 172   Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
2 173 
2 174   Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
2 175 
2 176   Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
2 177 
2 178   Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
2 179 
2 180   Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
2 181     Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
2 182 
2 183   Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
2 184     the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
2 185 
2 186   Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
2 187     wall.
2 188 
2 189   Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
2 190     are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
2 191     from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
2 192 
2 193   Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
2 194 
2 195   Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
2 196     fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
2 197     their heads.
2 198 
2 199   Greg. The heads of the maids?
2 200 
2 201   Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
2 202     Take it in what sense thou wilt.
2 203 
2 204   Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
2 205 
2 206   Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
2 207     am a pretty piece of flesh.
2 208 
2 209   Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
2 210     been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
2 211     Montagues.
2 212 
2 213            Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
2 214 
2 215 
2 216   Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
2 217 
2 218   Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
2 219 
2 220   Samp. Fear me not.
2 221 
2 222   Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
2 223 
2 224   Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
2 225 
2 226   Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
2 227 
2 228   Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
2 229     disgrace to them, if they bear it.
2 230 
2 231   Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
2 232 
2 233   Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
2 234 
2 235   Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
2 236 
2 237   Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
2 238 
2 239   Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.
2 240 
2 241   Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
2 242     thumb, sir.
2 243 
2 244   Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
2 245 
2 246   Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
2 247 
2 248   Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
2 249     you.
2 250 
2 251   Abr. No better.
2 252 
2 253   Samp. Well, sir.
2 254 
2 255                         Enter Benvolio.
2 256 
2 257 
2 258   Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
2 259     master's kinsmen.
2 260 
2 261   Samp. Yes, better, sir.
2 262 
2 263   Abr. You lie.
2 264 
2 265   Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
2 266                                                      They fight.
2 267 
2 268   Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
2 269     Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
2 270 
2 271                           Enter Tybalt.
2 272 
2 273 
2 274   Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
2 275     Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
2 276 
2 277   Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
2 278     Or manage it to part these men with me.
2 279 
2 280   Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
2 281     As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
2 282     Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
2 283 
2 284      Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
2 285                           partisans.
2 286 
2 287 
2 288   Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
2 289 
2 290   Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
2 291 
2 292            Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
2 293 
2 294 
2 295   Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
2 296 
2 297   Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
2 298 
2 299   Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
2 300     And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
2 301 
2 302                  Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
2 303 
2 304 
2 305   Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
2 306 
2 307   M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
2 308 
2 309                 Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
2 310 
2 311 
2 312   Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
2 313     Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
2 314     Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
2 315     That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
2 316     With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
2 317     On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
2 318     Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
2 319     And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
2 320     Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
2 321     By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
2 322     Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
2 323     And made Verona's ancient citizens
2 324     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
2 325     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
2 326     Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
2 327     If ever you disturb our streets again,
2 328     Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
2 329     For this time all the rest depart away.
2 330     You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
2 331     And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
2 332     To know our farther pleasure in this case,
2 333     To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
2 334     Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
2 335               Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
2 336 
2 337   Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
2 338     Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
2 339 
2 340   Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
2 341     And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
2 342     I drew to part them. In the instant came
2 343     The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
2 344     Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
2 345     He swung about his head and cut the winds,
2 346     Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
2 347     While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
2 348     Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
2 349     Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
2 350 
2 351   M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
2 352     Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
2 353 
2 354   Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
2 355     Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
2 356     A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
2 357     Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
2 358     That westward rooteth from the city's side,
2 359     So early walking did I see your son.
2 360     Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
2 361     And stole into the covert of the wood.
2 362     I- measuring his affections by my own,
2 363     Which then most sought where most might not be found,
2 364     Being one too many by my weary self-
2 365     Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
2 366     And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
2 367 
2 368   Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
2 369     With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
2 370     Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
2 371     But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
2 372     Should in the furthest East bean to draw
2 373     The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
2 374     Away from light steals home my heavy son
2 375     And private in his chamber pens himself,
2 376     Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
2 377     And makes himself an artificial night.
2 378     Black and portentous must this humour prove
2 379     Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
2 380 
2 381   Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
2 382 
2 383   Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
2 384 
2 385   Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
2 386 
2 387   Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
2 388     But he, his own affections' counsellor,
2 389     Is to himself- I will not say how true-
2 390     But to himself so secret and so close,
2 391     So far from sounding and discovery,
2 392     As is the bud bit with an envious worm
2 393     Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
2 394     Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
2 395     Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
2 396     We would as willingly give cure as know.
2 397 
2 398                        Enter Romeo.
2 399 
2 400 
2 401   Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
2 402     I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
2 403 
2 404   Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
2 405     To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
2 406                                      Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
2 407 
2 408   Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
2 409 
2 410   Rom. Is the day so young?
2 411 
2 412   Ben. But new struck nine.
2 413 
2 414   Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
2 415     Was that my father that went hence so fast?
2 416 
2 417   Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
2 418 
2 419   Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
2 420 
2 421   Ben. In love?
2 422 
2 423   Rom. Out-
2 424 
2 425   Ben. Of love?
2 426 
2 427   Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
2 428 
2 429   Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
2 430     Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
2 431 
2 432   Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
2 433     Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
2 434     Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
2 435     Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
2 436     Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
2 437     Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
2 438     O anything, of nothing first create!
2 439     O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
2 440     Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
2 441     Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
2 442     Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
2 443     This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
2 444     Dost thou not laugh?
2 445 
2 446   Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
2 447 
2 448   Rom. Good heart, at what?
2 449 
2 450   Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
2 451 
2 452   Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
2 453     Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
2 454     Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
2 455     With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
2 456     Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
2 457     Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
2 458     Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
2 459     Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
2 460     What is it else? A madness most discreet,
2 461     A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
2 462     Farewell, my coz.
2 463 
2 464   Ben. Soft! I will go along.
2 465     An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
2 466 
2 467   Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
2 468     This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
2 469 
2 470   Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
2 471 
2 472   Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
2 473 
2 474   Ben. Groan? Why, no;
2 475     But sadly tell me who.
2 476 
2 477   Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
2 478     Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
2 479     In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
2 480 
2 481   Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
2 482 
2 483   Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
2 484 
2 485   Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
2 486 
2 487   Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
2 488     With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
2 489     And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
2 490     From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
2 491     She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
2 492     Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
2 493     Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
2 494     O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
2 495     That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
2 496 
2 497   Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
2 498 
2 499   Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
2 500     For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
2 501     Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
2 502     She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
2 503     To merit bliss by making me despair.
2 504     She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
2 505     Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
2 506 
2 507   Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
2 508 
2 509   Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
2 510 
2 511   Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
2 512     Examine other beauties.
2 513 
2 514   Rom. 'Tis the way
2 515     To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
2 516     These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
2 517     Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
2 518     He that is strucken blind cannot forget
2 519     The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
2 520     Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
2 521     What doth her beauty serve but as a note
2 522     Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
2 523     Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
2 524 
2 525   Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
2 526

2 530 Scene II.
2 531 A Street.
2 532 
2 533 Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
2 534 
2 535 
2 536   Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
2 537     In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
2 538     For men so old as we to keep the peace.
2 539 
2 540   Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
2 541     And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
2 542     But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
2 543 
2 544   Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
2 545     My child is yet a stranger in the world,
2 546     She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
2 547     Let two more summers wither in their pride
2 548     Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
2 549 
2 550   Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
2 551 
2 552   Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
2 553     The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
2 554     She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
2 555     But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
2 556     My will to her consent is but a part.
2 557     An she agree, within her scope of choice
2 558     Lies my consent and fair according voice.
2 559     This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
2 560     Whereto I have invited many a guest,
2 561     Such as I love; and you among the store,
2 562     One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
2 563     At my poor house look to behold this night
2 564     Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
2 565     Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
2 566     When well apparell'd April on the heel
2 567     Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
2 568     Among fresh female buds shall you this night
2 569     Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
2 570     And like her most whose merit most shall be;
2 571     Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
2 572     May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
2 573     Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
2 574     sirrah, trudge about
2 575     Through fair Verona; find those persons out
2 576     Whose names are written there, and to them say,
2 577     My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
2 578                                      Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
2 579 
2 580   Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
2 581     that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
2 582     with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
2 583     with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
2 584     here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
2 585     hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
2 586 
2 587                    Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
2 588 
2 589 
2 590   Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
2 591     One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
2 592     Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
2 593     One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
2 594     Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
2 595     And the rank poison of the old will die.
2 596 
2 597   Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
2 598 
2 599   Ben. For what, I pray thee?
2 600 
2 601   Rom. For your broken shin.
2 602 
2 603   Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
2 604 
2 605   Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
2 606     Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
2 607     Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
2 608 
2 609   Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
2 610 
2 611   Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
2 612 
2 613   Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
2 614     you read anything you see?
2 615 
2 616   Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
2 617 
2 618   Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
2 619 
2 620   Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
2 621 
2 622       'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
2 623       County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
2 624       The lady widow of Vitruvio;
2 625       Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
2 626       Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
2 627       Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
2 628       My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
2 629       Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
2 630       Lucio and the lively Helena.'
2 631 
2 632     [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
2 633     come?
2 634 
2 635   Serv. Up.
2 636 
2 637   Rom. Whither?
2 638 
2 639   Serv. To supper, to our house.
2 640 
2 641   Rom. Whose house?
2 642 
2 643   Serv. My master's.
2 644 
2 645   Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
2 646 
2 647   Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
2 648     rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
2 649     come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.
2 650 
2 651   Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
2 652     Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
2 653     With all the admired beauties of Verona.
2 654     Go thither, and with unattainted eye
2 655     Compare her face with some that I shall show,
2 656     And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
2 657 
2 658   Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
2 659     Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
2 660     And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
2 661     Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
2 662     One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
2 663     Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
2 664 
2 665   Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
2 666     Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
2 667     But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
2 668     Your lady's love against some other maid
2 669     That I will show you shining at this feast,
2 670     And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
2 671 
2 672   Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
2 673     But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]
2 674

2 677 
2 678 Scene III.
2 679 Capulet's house.
2 680 
2 681 Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
2 682 
2 683 
2 684   Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
2 685 
2 686   Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
2 687     I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
2 688     God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
2 689 
2 690                          Enter Juliet.
2 691 
2 692 
2 693   Jul. How now? Who calls?
2 694 
2 695   Nurse. Your mother.
2 696 
2 697   Jul. Madam, I am here.
2 698     What is your will?
2 699 
2 700   Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
2 701     We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
2 702     I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
2 703     Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
2 704 
2 705   Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
2 706 
2 707   Wife. She's not fourteen.
2 708 
2 709   Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
2 710     And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
2 711     She is not fourteen. How long is it now
2 712     To Lammastide?
2 713 
2 714   Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
2 715 
2 716   Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
2 717     Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
2 718     Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
2 719     Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
2 720     She was too good for me. But, as I said,
2 721     On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
2 722     That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
2 723     'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
2 724     And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
2 725     Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
2 726     For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
2 727     Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
2 728     My lord and you were then at Mantua.
2 729     Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
2 730     When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
2 731     Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
2 732     To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
2 733     Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
2 734     To bid me trudge.
2 735     And since that time it is eleven years,
2 736     For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
2 737     She could have run and waddled all about;
2 738     For even the day before, she broke her brow;
2 739     And then my husband (God be with his soul!
2 740     'A was a merry man) took up the child.
2 741     'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
2 742     Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
2 743     Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
2 744     The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
2 745     To see now how a jest shall come about!
2 746     I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
2 747     I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
2 748     And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
2 749 
2 750   Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
2 751 
2 752   Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
2 753     To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
2 754     And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
2 755     A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
2 756     A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
2 757     'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
2 758     Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
2 759     Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
2 760 
2 761   Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
2 762 
2 763   Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
2 764     Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
2 765     An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
2 766 
2 767   Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
2 768     I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
2 769     How stands your disposition to be married?
2 770 
2 771   Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
2 772 
2 773   Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
2 774     I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
2 775 
2 776   Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
2 777     Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
2 778     Are made already mothers. By my count,
2 779     I was your mother much upon these years
2 780     That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
2 781     The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
2 782 
2 783   Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
2 784     As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
2 785 
2 786   Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
2 787 
2 788   Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
2 789 
2 790   Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
2 791     This night you shall behold him at our feast.
2 792     Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
2 793     And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
2 794     Examine every married lineament,
2 795     And see how one another lends content;
2 796     And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
2 797     Find written in the margent of his eyes,
2 798     This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
2 799     To beautify him only lacks a cover.
2 800     The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
2 801     For fair without the fair within to hide.
2 802     That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
2 803     That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
2 804     So shall you share all that he doth possess,
2 805     By having him making yourself no less.
2 806 
2 807   Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
2 808 
2 809   Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
2 810 
2 811   Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
2 812     But no more deep will I endart mine eye
2 813     Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
2 814 
2 815                         Enter Servingman.
2 816 
2 817 
2 818   Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
2 819     my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
2 820     everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
2 821     follow straight.
2 822 
2 823   Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
2 824     Juliet, the County stays.
2 825 
2 826   Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
2 827                                                          Exeunt.
2 828

2 830 
2 831 
2 832 Scene IV.
2 833 A street.
2 834 
2 835 Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
2 836 Torchbearers.
2 837 
2 838 
2 839   Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
2 840     Or shall we on without apology?
2 841 
2 842   Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
2 843     We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
2 844     Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
2 845     Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
2 846     Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
2 847     After the prompter, for our entrance;
2 848     But, let them measure us by what they will,
2 849     We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
2 850 
2 851   Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
2 852     Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
2 853 
2 854   Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
2 855 
2 856   Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
2 857     With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
2 858     So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
2 859 
2 860   Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
2 861     And soar with them above a common bound.
2 862 
2 863   Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
2 864     To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
2 865     I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
2 866     Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
2 867 
2 868   Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
2 869     Too great oppression for a tender thing.
2 870 
2 871   Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
2 872     Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
2 873 
2 874   Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
2 875     Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
2 876     Give me a case to put my visage in.
2 877     A visor for a visor! What care I
2 878     What curious eye doth quote deformities?
2 879     Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
2 880 
2 881   Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
2 882     But every man betake him to his legs.
2 883 
2 884   Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
2 885     Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
2 886     For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
2 887     I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
2 888     The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
2 889 
2 890   Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
2 891     If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
2 892     Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
2 893     Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
2 894 
2 895   Rom. Nay, that's not so.
2 896 
2 897   Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
2 898     We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
2 899     Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
2 900     Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
2 901 
2 902   Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
2 903     But 'tis no wit to go.
2 904 
2 905   Mer. Why, may one ask?
2 906 
2 907   Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
2 908 
2 909   Mer. And so did I.
2 910 
2 911   Rom. Well, what was yours?
2 912 
2 913   Mer. That dreamers often lie.
2 914 
2 915   Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
2 916 
2 917   Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
2 918     She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
2 919     In shape no bigger than an agate stone
2 920     On the forefinger of an alderman,
2 921     Drawn with a team of little atomies
2 922     Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
2 923     Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
2 924     The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
2 925     Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
2 926     Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
2 927     Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
2 928     Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
2 929     Not half so big as a round little worm
2 930     Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
2 931     Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
2 932     Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
2 933     Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
2 934     And in this state she 'gallops night by night
2 935     Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
2 936     O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
2 937     O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
2 938     O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
2 939     Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
2 940     Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
2 941     Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
2 942     And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
2 943     And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
2 944     Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
2 945     Then dreams he of another benefice.
2 946     Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
2 947     And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
2 948     Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
2 949     Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
2 950     Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
2 951     And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
2 952     And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
2 953     That plats the manes of horses in the night
2 954     And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
2 955     Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
2 956     This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
2 957     That presses them and learns them first to bear,
2 958     Making them women of good carriage.
2 959     This is she-
2 960 
2 961   Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
2 962     Thou talk'st of nothing.
2 963 
2 964   Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
2 965     Which are the children of an idle brain,
2 966     Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
2 967     Which is as thin of substance as the air,
2 968     And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
2 969     Even now the frozen bosom of the North
2 970     And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
2 971     Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
2 972 
2 973   Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
2 974     Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
2 975 
2 976   Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
2 977     Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
2 978     Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
2 979     With this night's revels and expire the term
2 980     Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
2 981     By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
2 982     But he that hath the steerage of my course
2 983     Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
2 984 
2 985   Ben. Strike, drum.
2 986                            They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]
2 987 
2 988

2 990 
2 991 Scene V.
2 992 Capulet's house.
2 993 
2 994 Servingmen come forth with napkins.
2 995 
2 996   1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
2 997     He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
2 998   2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
2 999     hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
2 1000   1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
2 1001     look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
2 1002     thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
2 1003 Nell.
2 1004     Anthony, and Potpan!
2 1005   2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
2 1006   1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
2 1007     sought for, in the great chamber.
2 1008   3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
2 1009     Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
2 1010 
2 1011     Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
2 1012               Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
2 1013                and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
2 1014 
2 1015 
2 1016   Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
2 1017     Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
2 1018     Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
2 1019     Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
2 1020     She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
2 1021     Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
2 1022     That I have worn a visor and could tell
2 1023     A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
2 1024     Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
2 1025     You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
2 1026     A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
2 1027                                     Music plays, and they dance.
2 1028     More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
2 1029     And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
2 1030     Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
2 1031     Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
2 1032     For you and I are past our dancing days.
2 1033     How long is't now since last yourself and I
2 1034     Were in a mask?
2 1035   2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
2 1036 
2 1037   Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
2 1038     'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
2 1039     Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
2 1040     Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
2 1041   2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
2 1042     His son is thirty.
2 1043 
2 1044   Cap. Will you tell me that?
2 1045     His son was but a ward two years ago.
2 1046 
2 1047   Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
2 1048     hand Of yonder knight?
2 1049 
2 1050   Serv. I know not, sir.
2 1051 
2 1052   Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
2 1053     It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
2 1054     Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
2 1055     Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
2 1056     So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
2 1057     As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
2 1058     The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
2 1059     And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
2 1060     Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
2 1061     For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
2 1062 
2 1063   Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
2 1064     Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
2 1065     Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
2 1066     To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
2 1067     Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
2 1068     To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
2 1069 
2 1070   Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
2 1071 
2 1072   Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
2 1073     A villain, that is hither come in spite
2 1074     To scorn at our solemnity this night.
2 1075 
2 1076   Cap. Young Romeo is it?
2 1077 
2 1078   Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
2 1079 
2 1080   Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
2 1081     'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
2 1082     And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
2 1083     To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
2 1084     I would not for the wealth of all this town
2 1085     Here in my house do him disparagement.
2 1086     Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
2 1087     It is my will; the which if thou respect,
2 1088     Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
2 1089     An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
2 1090 
2 1091   Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
2 1092     I'll not endure him.
2 1093 
2 1094   Cap. He shall be endur'd.
2 1095     What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
2 1096     Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
2 1097     You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
2 1098     You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
2 1099     You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
2 1100 
2 1101   Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
2 1102 
2 1103   Cap. Go to, go to!
2 1104     You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
2 1105     This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
2 1106     You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
2 1107     Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
2 1108     Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
2 1109     I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
2 1110 
2 1111   Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
2 1112     Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
2 1113     I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
2 1114     Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
2 1115 
2 1116   Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
2 1117     This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
2 1118     My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
2 1119     To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
2 1120 
2 1121   Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
2 1122     Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
2 1123     For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
2 1124     And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
2 1125 
2 1126   Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
2 1127 
2 1128   Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
2 1129 
2 1130   Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
2 1131     They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
2 1132 
2 1133   Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
2 1134 
2 1135   Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
2 1136     Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
2 1137 
2 1138   Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
2 1139 
2 1140   Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
2 1141     Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
2 1142 
2 1143   Jul. You kiss by th' book.
2 1144 
2 1145   Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
2 1146 
2 1147   Rom. What is her mother?
2 1148 
2 1149   Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
2 1150     Her mother is the lady of the house.
2 1151     And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
2 1152     I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
2 1153     I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
2 1154     Shall have the chinks.
2 1155 
2 1156   Rom. Is she a Capulet?
2 1157     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
2 1158 
2 1159   Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
2 1160 
2 1161   Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
2 1162 
2 1163   Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
2 1164     We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
2 1165     Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
2 1166     I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
2 1167     More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
2 1168     Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
2 1169     I'll to my rest.
2 1170                               Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
2 1171 
2 1172   Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
2 1173 
2 1174   Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
2 1175 
2 1176   Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
2 1177 
2 1178   Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
2 1179 
2 1180   Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
2 1181 
2 1182   Nurse. I know not.
2 1183 
2 1184   Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
2 1185     My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
2 1186 
2 1187   Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
2 1188     The only son of your great enemy.
2 1189 
2 1190   Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
2 1191     Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
2 1192     Prodigious birth of love it is to me
2 1193     That I must love a loathed enemy.
2 1194 
2 1195   Nurse. What's this? what's this?
2 1196 
2 1197   Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
2 1198     Of one I danc'd withal.
2 1199                                      One calls within, 'Juliet.'
2 1200 
2 1201   Nurse. Anon, anon!
2 1202     Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.
2 1203 
2 1204 
2 1205 
2 1206 
2 1207 PROLOGUE
2 1208 
2 1209 Enter Chorus.
2 1210 
2 1211 
2 1212   Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
2 1213     And young affection gapes to be his heir;
2 1214     That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
2 1215     With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
2 1216     Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
2 1217     Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
2 1218     But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
2 1219     And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
2 1220     Being held a foe, he may not have access
2 1221     To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
2 1222     And she as much in love, her means much less
2 1223     To meet her new beloved anywhere;
2 1224     But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
2 1225     Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
2 1226 Exit.
2 1227 
2 1228 
2 1229 
2 1230 
2 1231 ACT II. Scene I.
2 1232 A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
2 1233 
2 1234 Enter Romeo alone.
2 1235 
2 1236 
2 1237   Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
2 1238     Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
2 1239                      [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
2 1240 
2 1241                    Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
2 1242 
2 1243 
2 1244   Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
2 1245 
2 1246   Mer. He is wise,
2 1247     And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
2 1248 
2 1249   Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
2 1250     Call, good Mercutio.
2 1251 
2 1252   Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
2 1253     Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
2 1254     Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
2 1255     Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
2 1256     Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
2 1257     Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
2 1258     One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
2 1259     Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
2 1260     When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
2 1261     He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
2 1262     The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
2 1263     I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
2 1264     By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
2 1265     By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
2 1266     And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
2 1267     That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
2 1268 
2 1269   Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
2 1270 
2 1271   Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
2 1272     To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
2 1273     Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
2 1274     Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
2 1275     That were some spite; my invocation
2 1276     Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
2 1277     I conjure only but to raise up him.
2 1278 
2 1279   Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
2 1280     To be consorted with the humorous night.
2 1281     Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
2 1282 
2 1283   Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
2 1284     Now will he sit under a medlar tree
2 1285     And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
2 1286     As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
2 1287     O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
2 1288     An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
2 1289     Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
2 1290     This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
2 1291     Come, shall we go?
2 1292 
2 1293   Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
2 1294     'To seek him here that means not to be found.
2 1295                                                          Exeunt.
2 1296

2 1299 
2 1300 Scene II.
2 1301 Capulet's orchard.
2 1302 
2 1303 Enter Romeo.
2 1304 
2 1305 
2 1306   Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
2 1307 
2 1308                      Enter Juliet above at a window.
2 1309 
2 1310     But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
2 1311     It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
2 1312     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
2 1313     Who is already sick and pale with grief
2 1314     That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
2 1315     Be not her maid, since she is envious.
2 1316     Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
2 1317     And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
2 1318     It is my lady; O, it is my love!
2 1319     O that she knew she were!
2 1320     She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
2 1321     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
2 1322     I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
2 1323     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
2 1324     Having some business, do entreat her eyes
2 1325     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
2 1326     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
2 1327     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
2 1328     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
2 1329     Would through the airy region stream so bright
2 1330     That birds would sing and think it were not night.
2 1331     See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
2 1332     O that I were a glove upon that hand,
2 1333     That I might touch that cheek!
2 1334 
2 1335   Jul. Ay me!
2 1336 
2 1337   Rom. She speaks.
2 1338     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
2 1339     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
2 1340     As is a winged messenger of heaven
2 1341     Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
2 1342     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
2 1343     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
2 1344     And sails upon the bosom of the air.
2 1345 
2 1346   Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
2 1347     Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
2 1348     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
2 1349     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
2 1350 
2 1351   Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
2 1352 
2 1353   Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
2 1354     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
2 1355     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
2 1356     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
2 1357     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
2 1358     What's in a name? That which we call a rose
2 1359     By any other name would smell as sweet.
2 1360     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
2 1361     Retain that dear perfection which he owes
2 1362     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
2 1363     And for that name, which is no part of thee,
2 1364     Take all myself.
2 1365 
2 1366   Rom. I take thee at thy word.
2 1367     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
2 1368     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
2 1369 
2 1370   Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
2 1371     So stumblest on my counsel?
2 1372 
2 1373   Rom. By a name
2 1374     I know not how to tell thee who I am.
2 1375     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
2 1376     Because it is an enemy to thee.
2 1377     Had I it written, I would tear the word.
2 1378 
2 1379   Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
2 1380     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
2 1381     Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
2 1382 
2 1383   Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
2 1384 
2 1385   Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
2 1386     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
2 1387     And the place death, considering who thou art,
2 1388     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
2 1389 
2 1390   Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
2 1391     For stony limits cannot hold love out,
2 1392     And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
2 1393     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
2 1394 
2 1395   Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
2 1396 
2 1397   Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
2 1398     Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
2 1399     And I am proof against their enmity.
2 1400 
2 1401   Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
2 1402 
2 1403   Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
2 1404     And but thou love me, let them find me here.
2 1405     My life were better ended by their hate
2 1406     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
2 1407 
2 1408   Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
2 1409 
2 1410   Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
2 1411     He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
2 1412     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
2 1413     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
2 1414     I would adventure for such merchandise.
2 1415 
2 1416   Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
2 1417     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
2 1418     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
2 1419     Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
2 1420     What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
2 1421     Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
2 1422     And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
2 1423     Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
2 1424     They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
2 1425     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
2 1426     Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
2 1427     I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
2 1428     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
2 1429     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
2 1430     And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
2 1431     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
2 1432     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
2 1433     I should have been more strange, I must confess,
2 1434     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
2 1435     My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
2 1436     And not impute this yielding to light love,
2 1437     Which the dark night hath so discovered.
2 1438 
2 1439   Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
2 1440     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
2 1441 
2 1442   Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
2 1443     That monthly changes in her circled orb,
2 1444     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
2 1445 
2 1446   Rom. What shall I swear by?
2 1447 
2 1448   Jul. Do not swear at all;
2 1449     Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
2 1450     Which is the god of my idolatry,
2 1451     And I'll believe thee.
2 1452 
2 1453   Rom. If my heart's dear love-
2 1454 
2 1455   Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
2 1456     I have no joy of this contract to-night.
2 1457     It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
2 1458     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
2 1459     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
2 1460     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
2 1461     May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
2 1462     Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
2 1463     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
2 1464 
2 1465   Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
2 1466 
2 1467   Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
2 1468 
2 1469   Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
2 1470 
2 1471   Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
2 1472     And yet I would it were to give again.
2 1473 
2 1474   Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
2 1475 
2 1476   Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
2 1477     And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
2 1478     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
2 1479     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
2 1480     The more I have, for both are infinite.
2 1481     I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
2 1482                                            [Nurse] calls within.
2 1483     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
2 1484     Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
2 1485 
2 1486   Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
2 1487     Being in night, all this is but a dream,
2 1488     Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
2 1489 
2 1490                        Enter Juliet above.
2 1491 
2 1492 
2 1493   Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
2 1494     If that thy bent of love be honourable,
2 1495     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
2 1496     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
2 1497     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
2 1498     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
2 1499     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
2 1500 
2 1501   Nurse. (within) Madam!
2 1502 
2 1503   Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
2 1504     I do beseech thee-
2 1505 
2 1506   Nurse. (within) Madam!
2 1507 
2 1508   Jul. By-and-by I come.-
2 1509     To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
2 1510     To-morrow will I send.
2 1511 
2 1512   Rom. So thrive my soul-
2 1513 
2 1514   Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
2 1515 
2 1516   Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
2 1517     Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
2 1518     But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
2 1519 
2 1520                      Enter Juliet again, [above].
2 1521 
2 1522 
2 1523   Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
2 1524     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
2 1525     Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
2 1526     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
2 1527     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
2 1528     With repetition of my Romeo's name.
2 1529     Romeo!
2 1530 
2 1531   Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
2 1532     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
2 1533     Like softest music to attending ears!
2 1534 
2 1535   Jul. Romeo!
2 1536 
2 1537   Rom. My dear?
2 1538 
2 1539   Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
2 1540     Shall I send to thee?
2 1541 
2 1542   Rom. By the hour of nine.
2 1543 
2 1544   Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
2 1545     I have forgot why I did call thee back.
2 1546 
2 1547   Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
2 1548 
2 1549   Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
2 1550     Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
2 1551 
2 1552   Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
2 1553     Forgetting any other home but this.
2 1554 
2 1555   Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
2 1556     And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
2 1557     That lets it hop a little from her hand,
2 1558     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
2 1559     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
2 1560     So loving-jealous of his liberty.
2 1561 
2 1562   Rom. I would I were thy bird.
2 1563 
2 1564   Jul. Sweet, so would I.
2 1565     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
2 1566     Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
2 1567     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
2 1568                                                          [Exit.]
2 1569 
2 1570   Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
2 1571     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
2 1572     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
2 1573     His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
2 1574  Exit
2 1575 
2 1576 
2 1577 
2 1578 
2 1579 Scene III.
2 1580 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 1581 
2 1582 Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
2 1583 
2 1584 
2 1585   Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
2 1586     Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
2 1587     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
2 1588     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
2 1589     Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
2 1590     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
2 1591     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
2 1592     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
2 1593     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
2 1594     What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
2 1595     And from her womb children of divers kind
2 1596     We sucking on her natural bosom find;
2 1597     Many for many virtues excellent,
2 1598     None but for some, and yet all different.
2 1599     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
2 1600     In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
2 1601     For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
2 1602     But to the earth some special good doth give;
2 1603     Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
2 1604     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
2 1605     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
2 1606     And vice sometime's by action dignified.
2 1607     Within the infant rind of this small flower
2 1608     Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
2 1609     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
2 1610     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
2 1611     Two such opposed kings encamp them still
2 1612     In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
2 1613     And where the worser is predominant,
2 1614     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
2 1615 
2 1616                         Enter Romeo.
2 1617 
2 1618 
2 1619   Rom. Good morrow, father.
2 1620 
2 1621   Friar. Benedicite!
2 1622     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
2 1623     Young son, it argues a distempered head
2 1624     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
2 1625     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
2 1626     And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
2 1627     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
2 1628     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
2 1629     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
2 1630     Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
2 1631     Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
2 1632     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
2 1633 
2 1634   Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
2 1635 
2 1636   Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
2 1637 
2 1638   Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
2 1639     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
2 1640 
2 1641   Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
2 1642 
2 1643   Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
2 1644     I have been feasting with mine enemy,
2 1645     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
2 1646     That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
2 1647     Within thy help and holy physic lies.
2 1648     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
2 1649     My intercession likewise steads my foe.
2 1650 
2 1651   Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
2 1652     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
2 1653 
2 1654   Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
2 1655     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
2 1656     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
2 1657     And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
2 1658     By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
2 1659     We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
2 1660     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
2 1661     That thou consent to marry us to-day.
2 1662 
2 1663   Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
2 1664     Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
2 1665     So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
2 1666     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
2 1667     Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
2 1668     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
2 1669     How much salt water thrown away in waste,
2 1670     To season love, that of it doth not taste!
2 1671     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
2 1672     Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
2 1673     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
2 1674     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
2 1675     If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
2 1676     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
2 1677     And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
2 1678     Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
2 1679 
2 1680   Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
2 1681 
2 1682   Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
2 1683 
2 1684   Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
2 1685 
2 1686   Friar. Not in a grave
2 1687     To lay one in, another out to have.
2 1688 
2 1689   Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
2 1690     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
2 1691     The other did not so.
2 1692 
2 1693   Friar. O, she knew well
2 1694     Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
2 1695     But come, young waverer, come go with me.
2 1696     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
2 1697     For this alliance may so happy prove
2 1698     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
2 1699 
2 1700   Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
2 1701 
2 1702   Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
2 1703                                                          Exeunt.

2 1708 Scene IV.
2 1709 A street.
2 1710 
2 1711 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
2 1712 
2 1713 
2 1714   Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
2 1715     Came he not home to-night?
2 1716 
2 1717   Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
2 1718 
2 1719   Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
2 1720     Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
2 1721 
2 1722   Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
2 1723     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
2 1724 
2 1725   Mer. A challenge, on my life.
2 1726 
2 1727   Ben. Romeo will answer it.
2 1728 
2 1729   Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
2 1730 
2 1731   Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
2 1732     being dared.
2 1733 
2 1734   Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
2 1735     wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
2 1736     very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
2 1737     butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
2 1738 
2 1739   Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
2 1740 
2 1741   Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
2 1742     courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
2 1743     pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
2 1744     minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
2 1745     butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
2 1746     of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
2 1747     immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
2 1748 
2 1749   Ben. The what?
2 1750 
2 1751   Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
2 1752     these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
2 1753     tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
2 1754     grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
2 1755     flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
2 1756     so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
2 1757     bench? O, their bones, their bones!
2 1758 
2 1759                                Enter Romeo.
2 1760 
2 1761 
2 1762   Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
2 1763 
2 1764   Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
2 1765     art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
2 1766     flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
2 1767     had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
2 1768     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
2 1769     but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
2 1770     salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
2 1771     fairly last night.
2 1772 
2 1773   Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
2 1774 
2 1775   Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
2 1776 
2 1777   Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
2 1778     case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
2 1779 
2 1780   Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
2 1781     man to bow in the hams.
2 1782 
2 1783   Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
2 1784 
2 1785   Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
2 1786 
2 1787   Rom. A most courteous exposition.
2 1788 
2 1789   Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
2 1790 
2 1791   Rom. Pink for flower.
2 1792 
2 1793   Mer. Right.
2 1794 
2 1795   Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
2 1796 
2 1797   Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
2 1798     thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
2 1799     remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
2 1800 
2 1801   Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
2 1802 
2 1803   Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
2 1804 
2 1805   Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
2 1806 
2 1807   Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
2 1808     thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
2 1809     sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
2 1810 
2 1811   Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
2 1812     there for the goose.
2 1813 
2 1814   Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
2 1815 
2 1816   Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
2 1817 
2 1818   Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
2 1819 
2 1820   Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
2 1821 
2 1822   Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
2 1823     narrow to an ell broad!
2 1824 
2 1825   Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
2 1826     the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
2 1827 
2 1828   Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
2 1829     art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
2 1830     art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
2 1831     great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
2 1832     a hole.
2 1833 
2 1834   Ben. Stop there, stop there!
2 1835 
2 1836   Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
2 1837 
2 1838   Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
2 1839 
2 1840   Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
2 1841     was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
2 1842     occupy the argument no longer.
2 1843 
2 1844   Rom. Here's goodly gear!
2 1845 
2 1846                       Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
2 1847 
2 1848 
2 1849   Mer. A sail, a sail!
2 1850 
2 1851   Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
2 1852 
2 1853   Nurse. Peter!
2 1854 
2 1855   Peter. Anon.
2 1856 
2 1857   Nurse. My fan, Peter.
2 1858 
2 1859   Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
2 1860     the two.
2 1861 
2 1862   Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
2 1863 
2 1864   Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
2 1865 
2 1866   Nurse. Is it good-den?
2 1867 
2 1868   Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
2 1869     now upon the prick of noon.
2 1870 
2 1871   Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
2 1872 
2 1873   Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
2 1874 
2 1875   Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
2 1876     quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
2 1877     young Romeo?
2 1878 
2 1879   Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
2 1880     have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
2 1881     of that name, for fault of a worse.
2 1882 
2 1883   Nurse. You say well.
2 1884 
2 1885   Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
2 1886     wisely.
2 1887 
2 1888   Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
2 1889 
2 1890   Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
2 1891 
2 1892   Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
2 1893 
2 1894   Rom. What hast thou found?
2 1895 
2 1896   Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
2 1897     something stale and hoar ere it be spent
2 1898                                      He walks by them and sings.
2 1899 
2 1900                    An old hare hoar,
2 1901                    And an old hare hoar,
2 1902                 Is very good meat in Lent;
2 1903                    But a hare that is hoar
2 1904                    Is too much for a score
2 1905                 When it hoars ere it be spent.
2 1906 
2 1907     Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
2 1908 
2 1909   Rom. I will follow you.
2 1910 
2 1911   Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
2 1912     [sings] lady, lady, lady.
2 1913                                       Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
2 1914 
2 1915   Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
2 1916     was this that was so full of his ropery?
2 1917 
2 1918   Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
2 1919     will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
2 1920 
2 1921   Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
2 1922 'a
2 1923     were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
2 1924     I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
2 1925     flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
2 1926     stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
2 1927 
2 1928   Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
2 1929     weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
2 1930     soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
2 1931     law on my side.
2 1932 
2 1933   Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
2 1934     quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
2 1935     my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
2 1936     will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
2 1937     her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
2 1938     behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
2 1939     therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
2 1940     an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
2 1941 
2 1942   Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
2 1943     thee-
2 1944 
2 1945   Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
2 1946     Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
2 1947 
2 1948   Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
2 1949 
2 1950   Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
2 1951     take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2 1952 
2 1953   Rom. Bid her devise
2 1954     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2 1955     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2 1956     Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
2 1957 
2 1958   Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
2 1959 
2 1960   Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
2 1961 
2 1962   Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
2 1963 
2 1964   Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
2 1965     Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2 1966     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
2 1967     Which to the high topgallant of my joy
2 1968     Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2 1969     Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
2 1970     Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
2 1971 
2 1972   Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2 1973 
2 1974   Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2 1975 
2 1976   Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2 1977     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2 1978 
2 1979   Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
2 1980 
2 1981   Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
2 1982     when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
2 1983     town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
2 1984     good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
2 1985     anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
2 1986     but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
2 1987     clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
2 1988     with a letter?
2 1989 
2 1990   Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
2 1991 
2 1992   Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
2 1993     know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
2 1994     sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
2 1995     good to hear it.
2 1996 
2 1997   Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
2 1998 
2 1999   Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
2 2000 
2 2001   Peter. Anon.
2 2002 
2 2003   Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
2 2004                                                          Exeunt.
2 2005 
2 2006 
2 2007 
2 2008 
2 2009 Scene V.
2 2010 Capulet's orchard.
2 2011 
2 2012 Enter Juliet.
2 2013 
2 2014 
2 2015   Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2 2016     In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
2 2017     Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
2 2018     O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
2 2019     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
2 2020     Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
2 2021     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
2 2022     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2 2023     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2 2024     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2 2025     Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
2 2026     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2 2027     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2 2028     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2 2029     And his to me,
2 2030     But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
2 2031     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2 2032 
2 2033                       Enter Nurse [and Peter].
2 2034 
2 2035     O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
2 2036     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2 2037 
2 2038   Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
2 2039                                                    [Exit Peter.]
2 2040 
2 2041   Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2 2042     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2 2043     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2 2044     By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2 2045 
2 2046   Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
2 2047     Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
2 2048 
2 2049   Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
2 2050     Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
2 2051 
2 2052   Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
2 2053     Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2 2054 
2 2055   Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
2 2056     To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2 2057     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2 2058     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2 2059     Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
2 2060     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
2 2061     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2 2062 
2 2063   Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
2 2064     choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
2 2065     than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
2 2066     foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
2 2067     they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
2 2068     warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
2 2069 God.
2 2070     What, have you din'd at home?
2 2071 
2 2072   Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
2 2073     What says he of our marriage? What of that?
2 2074 
2 2075   Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
2 2076     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2 2077     My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
2 2078     Beshrew your heart for sending me about
2 2079     To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
2 2080 
2 2081   Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2 2082     Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2 2083 
2 2084   Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
2 2085     and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
2 2086     is your mother?
2 2087 
2 2088   Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
2 2089     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2 2090     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2 2091     "Where is your mother?"'
2 2092 
2 2093   Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
2 2094     Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
2 2095     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2 2096     Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2 2097 
2 2098   Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
2 2099 
2 2100   Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
2 2101 
2 2102   Jul. I have.
2 2103 
2 2104   Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
2 2105     There stays a husband to make you a wife.
2 2106     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
2 2107     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2 2108     Hie you to church; I must another way,
2 2109     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2 2110     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
2 2111     I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
2 2112     But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
2 2113     Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
2 2114 
2 2115   Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
2 2116                                                          Exeunt.

2 2120 
2 2121 Scene VI.
2 2122 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 2123 
2 2124 Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
2 2125 
2 2126 
2 2127   Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
2 2128     That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
2 2129 
2 2130   Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
2 2131     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2 2132     That one short minute gives me in her sight.
2 2133     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2 2134     Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
2 2135     It is enough I may but call her mine.
2 2136 
2 2137   Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
2 2138     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2 2139     Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
2 2140     Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2 2141     And in the taste confounds the appetite.
2 2142     Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
2 2143     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2 2144 
2 2145                      Enter Juliet.
2 2146 
2 2147     Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
2 2148     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
2 2149     A lover may bestride the gossamer
2 2150     That idles in the wanton summer air,
2 2151     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
2 2152 
2 2153   Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2 2154 
2 2155   Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2 2156 
2 2157   Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2 2158 
2 2159   Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2 2160     Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
2 2161     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2 2162     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2 2163     Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
2 2164     Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2 2165 
2 2166   Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2 2167     Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
2 2168     They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2 2169     But my true love is grown to such excess
2 2170     cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2 2171 
2 2172   Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2 2173     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2 2174     Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
2 2175                                                        [Exeunt.]

2 2179 
2 2180 ACT III. Scene I.
2 2181 A public place.
2 2182 
2 2183 Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
2 2184 
2 2185 
2 2186   Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
2 2187     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
2 2188     And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
2 2189     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2 2190 
2 2191   Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
2 2192     the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
2 2193     says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
2 2194     second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2 2195 
2 2196   Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
2 2197 
2 2198   Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
2 2199     Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
2 2200     moved.
2 2201 
2 2202   Ben. And what to?
2 2203 
2 2204   Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
2 2205     for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
2 2206     man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
2 2207     Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2 2208     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
2 2209     eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
2 2210     as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
2 2211     addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
2 2212     man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
2 2213     that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
2 2214     tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
2 2215     another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
2 2216     tutor me from quarrelling!
2 2217 
2 2218   Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
2 2219     buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2 2220 
2 2221   Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
2 2222 
2 2223                        Enter Tybalt and others.
2 2224 
2 2225 
2 2226   Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
2 2227 
2 2228   Mer. By my heel, I care not.
2 2229 
2 2230   Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2 2231     Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
2 2232 
2 2233   Mer. And but one word with one of us?
2 2234     Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
2 2235 
2 2236   Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
2 2237     occasion.
2 2238 
2 2239   Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
2 2240 
2 2241   Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
2 2242 
2 2243   Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
2 2244     minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
2 2245     fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
2 2246 
2 2247   Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
2 2248     Either withdraw unto some private place
2 2249     And reason coldly of your grievances,
2 2250     Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
2 2251 
2 2252   Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
2 2253     I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
2 2254 
2 2255                         Enter Romeo.
2 2256 
2 2257 
2 2258   Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
2 2259 
2 2260   Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
2 2261     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
2 2262     Your worship in that sense may call him man.
2 2263 
2 2264   Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
2 2265     No better term than this: thou art a villain.
2 2266 
2 2267   Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2 2268     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2 2269     To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
2 2270     Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
2 2271 
2 2272   Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2 2273     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2 2274 
2 2275   Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
2 2276     But love thee better than thou canst devise
2 2277     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
2 2278     And so good Capulet, which name I tender
2 2279     As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
2 2280 
2 2281   Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2 2282     Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
2 2283     Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
2 2284 
2 2285   Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
2 2286 
2 2287   Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
2 2288 That I
2 2289     mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
2 2290 
2 2291     dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
2 2292     of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
2 2293     ears ere it be out.
2 2294 
2 2295   Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
2 2296 
2 2297   Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2 2298 
2 2299   Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
2 2300                                                    [They fight.]
2 2301 
2 2302   Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2 2303     Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
2 2304     Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
2 2305     Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
2 2306     Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
2 2307          Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
2 2308                                            [with his Followers].
2 2309 
2 2310   Mer. I am hurt.
2 2311     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2 2312     Is he gone and hath nothing?
2 2313 
2 2314   Ben. What, art thou hurt?
2 2315 
2 2316   Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
2 2317     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2 2318                                                     [Exit Page.]
2 2319 
2 2320   Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
2 2321 
2 2322   Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
2 2323     but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
2 2324     shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
2 2325     world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
2 2326     mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
2 2327 a
2 2328     villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
2 2329     came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
2 2330 
2 2331   Rom. I thought all for the best.
2 2332 
2 2333   Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2 2334     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2 2335     They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
2 2336     And soundly too. Your houses!
2 2337                                  [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].
2 2338 
2 2339   Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
2 2340     My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
2 2341     In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
2 2342     With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
2 2343     Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
2 2344     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2 2345     And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
2 2346 
2 2347                       Enter Benvolio.
2 2348 
2 2349 
2 2350   Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2 2351     That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
2 2352     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2 2353 
2 2354   Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
2 2355     This but begins the woe others must end.
2 2356 
2 2357                        Enter Tybalt.
2 2358 
2 2359 
2 2360   Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2 2361 
2 2362   Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
2 2363     Away to heaven respective lenity,
2 2364     And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
2 2365     Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
2 2366     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2 2367     Is but a little way above our heads,
2 2368     Staying for thine to keep him company.
2 2369     Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
2 2370 
2 2371   Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2 2372     Shalt with him hence.
2 2373 
2 2374   Rom. This shall determine that.
2 2375                                        They fight. Tybalt falls.
2 2376 
2 2377   Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
2 2378     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2 2379     Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
2 2380     If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
2 2381 
2 2382   Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
2 2383 
2 2384   Ben. Why dost thou stay?
2 2385                                                      Exit Romeo.
2 2386                       Enter Citizens.
2 2387 
2 2388 
2 2389   Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2 2390     Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
2 2391 
2 2392   Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
2 2393 
2 2394   Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
2 2395     I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
2 2396 
2 2397 
2 2398   Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
2 2399                      and [others].
2 2400 
2 2401 
2 2402   Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2 2403 
2 2404   Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
2 2405     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
2 2406     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2 2407     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2 2408 
2 2409   Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2 2410     O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
2 2411     Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2 2412     For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
2 2413     O cousin, cousin!
2 2414 
2 2415   Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2 2416 
2 2417   Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
2 2418     Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
2 2419     How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
2 2420     Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
2 2421     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
2 2422     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2 2423     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2 2424     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
2 2425     Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2 2426     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2 2427     Cold death aside and with the other sends
2 2428     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
2 2429     Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
2 2430     'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
2 2431     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2 2432     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2 2433     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2 2434     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2 2435     But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
2 2436     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2 2437     And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
2 2438     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
2 2439     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2 2440     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2 2441 
2 2442   Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2 2443     Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
2 2444     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2 2445     And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2 2446     I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
2 2447     Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
2 2448 
2 2449   Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
2 2450     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2 2451 
2 2452   Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
2 2453     His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2 2454     The life of Tybalt.
2 2455 
2 2456   Prince. And for that offence
2 2457     Immediately we do exile him hence.
2 2458     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2 2459     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2 2460     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2 2461     That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
2 2462     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2 2463     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
2 2464     Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
2 2465     Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
2 2466     Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
2 2467     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2 2468                                                          Exeunt.

2 2473 Scene II.
2 2474 Capulet's orchard.
2 2475 
2 2476 Enter Juliet alone.
2 2477 
2 2478 
2 2479   Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2 2480     Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
2 2481     As Phaeton would whip you to the West
2 2482     And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2 2483     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2 2484     That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
2 2485     Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
2 2486     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2 2487     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2 2488     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2 2489     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2 2490     And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2 2491     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
2 2492     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2 2493     With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
2 2494     Think true love acted simple modesty.
2 2495     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2 2496     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2 2497     Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
2 2498     Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
2 2499     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2 2500     Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2 2501     And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2 2502     That all the world will be in love with night
2 2503     And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2 2504     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2 2505     But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
2 2506     Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
2 2507     As is the night before some festival
2 2508     To an impatient child that hath new robes
2 2509     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2 2510 
2 2511                 Enter Nurse, with cords.
2 2512 
2 2513     And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2 2514     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2 2515     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2 2516     That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2 2517 
2 2518   Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
2 2519                                              [Throws them down.]
2 2520 
2 2521   Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
2 2522 
2 2523   Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2 2524     We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2 2525     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2 2526 
2 2527   Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
2 2528 
2 2529   Nurse. Romeo can,
2 2530     Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
2 2531     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2 2532 
2 2533   Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
2 2534     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2 2535     Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
2 2536     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2 2537     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
2 2538     I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
2 2539     Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
2 2540     If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
2 2541     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2 2542 
2 2543   Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
2 2544     (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
2 2545     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2 2546     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2 2547     All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
2 2548 
2 2549   Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
2 2550     To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
2 2551     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
2 2552     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2 2553 
2 2554   Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2 2555     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
2 2556     That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2 2557 
2 2558   Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2 2559     Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
2 2560     My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
2 2561     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2 2562     For who is living, if those two are gone?
2 2563 
2 2564   Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2 2565     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2 2566 
2 2567   Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2 2568 
2 2569   Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
2 2570 
2 2571   Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
2 2572     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2 2573     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2 2574     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2 2575     Despised substance of divinest show!
2 2576     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
2 2577     A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2 2578     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
2 2579     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2 2580     In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
2 2581     Was ever book containing such vile matter
2 2582     So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
2 2583     In such a gorgeous palace!
2 2584 
2 2585   Nurse. There's no trust,
2 2586     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
2 2587     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2 2588     Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
2 2589     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2 2590     Shame come to Romeo!
2 2591 
2 2592   Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
2 2593     For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
2 2594     Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
2 2595     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2 2596     Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2 2597     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2 2598 
2 2599   Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2 2600 
2 2601   Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2 2602     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
2 2603     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2 2604     But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2 2605     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
2 2606     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
2 2607     Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2 2608     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2 2609     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2 2610     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
2 2611     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2 2612     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2 2613     That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
2 2614     But O, it presses to my memory
2 2615     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
2 2616     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
2 2617     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2 2618     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2 2619     Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
2 2620     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2 2621     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2 2622     Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2 2623     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2 2624     Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
2 2625     But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
2 2626     'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
2 2627     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2 2628     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
2 2629     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2 2630     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2 2631     Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
2 2632 
2 2633   Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
2 2634     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2 2635 
2 2636   Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
2 2637     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2 2638     Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
2 2639     Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
2 2640     He made you for a highway to my bed;
2 2641     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2 2642     Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
2 2643     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2 2644 
2 2645   Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
2 2646     To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
2 2647     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
2 2648     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2 2649 
2 2650   Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
2 2651     And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2 2652                                                          Exeunt.
2 2653

2 2656 
2 2657 Scene III.
2 2658 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 2659 
2 2660 Enter Friar [Laurence].
2 2661 
2 2662 
2 2663   Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
2 2664     Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
2 2665     And thou art wedded to calamity.
2 2666 
2 2667                          Enter Romeo.
2 2668 
2 2669 
2 2670   Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
2 2671     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
2 2672     That I yet know not?
2 2673 
2 2674   Friar. Too familiar
2 2675     Is my dear son with such sour company.
2 2676     I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
2 2677 
2 2678   Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
2 2679 
2 2680   Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
2 2681     Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2 2682 
2 2683   Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
2 2684     For exile hath more terror in his look,
2 2685     Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
2 2686 
2 2687   Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
2 2688     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2 2689 
2 2690   Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
2 2691     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2 2692     Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
2 2693     And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
2 2694     Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
2 2695     Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
2 2696     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2 2697 
2 2698   Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2 2699     Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
2 2700     Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2 2701     And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
2 2702     This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2 2703 
2 2704   Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
2 2705     Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2 2706     And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2 2707     Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2 2708     But Romeo may not. More validity,
2 2709     More honourable state, more courtship lives
2 2710     In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
2 2711     On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2 2712     And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2 2713     Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
2 2714     Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2 2715     But Romeo may not- he is banished.
2 2716     This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
2 2717     They are free men, but I am banished.
2 2718     And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
2 2719     Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2 2720     No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2 2721     But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
2 2722     O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2 2723     Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
2 2724     Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2 2725     A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2 2726     To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2 2727 
2 2728   Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
2 2729 
2 2730   Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2 2731 
2 2732   Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
2 2733     Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2 2734     To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2 2735 
2 2736   Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2 2737     Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2 2738     Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2 2739     It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
2 2740 
2 2741   Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2 2742 
2 2743   Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2 2744 
2 2745   Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2 2746 
2 2747   Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
2 2748     Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2 2749     An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2 2750     Doting like me, and like me banished,
2 2751     Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2 2752     And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2 2753     Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2 2754                                                  Knock [within].
2 2755 
2 2756   Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
2 2757 
2 2758   Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2 2759     Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
2 2760 
2 2761   Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2 2762     Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
2 2763     Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
2 2764     What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
2 2765     Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
2 2766 
2 2767   Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
2 2768     I come from Lady Juliet.
2 2769 
2 2770   Friar. Welcome then.
2 2771 
2 2772                        Enter Nurse.
2 2773 
2 2774 
2 2775   Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
2 2776     Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2 2777 
2 2778   Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2 2779 
2 2780   Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2 2781     Just in her case!
2 2782 
2 2783   Friar. O woeful sympathy!
2 2784     Piteous predicament!
2 2785 
2 2786   Nurse. Even so lies she,
2 2787     Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2 2788     Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
2 2789     For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
2 2790     Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2 2791 
2 2792   Rom. (rises) Nurse-
2 2793 
2 2794   Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2 2795 
2 2796   Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
2 2797     Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
2 2798     Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2 2799     With blood remov'd but little from her own?
2 2800     Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
2 2801     My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2 2802 
2 2803   Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2 2804     And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
2 2805     And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2 2806     And then down falls again.
2 2807 
2 2808   Rom. As if that name,
2 2809     Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2 2810     Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
2 2811     Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2 2812     In what vile part of this anatomy
2 2813     Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
2 2814     The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
2 2815 
2 2816   Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
2 2817     Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
2 2818     Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
2 2819     The unreasonable fury of a beast.
2 2820     Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2 2821     Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2 2822     Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
2 2823     I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2 2824     Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
2 2825     And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
2 2826     By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2 2827     Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2 2828     Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
2 2829     In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2 2830     Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
2 2831     Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2 2832     And usest none in that true use indeed
2 2833     Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
2 2834     Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
2 2835     Digressing from the valour of a man;
2 2836     Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2 2837     Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2 2838     Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2 2839     Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2 2840     Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
2 2841     is get afire by thine own ignorance,
2 2842     And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
2 2843     What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
2 2844     For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
2 2845     There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
2 2846     But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
2 2847     The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
2 2848     And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
2 2849     A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
2 2850     Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2 2851     But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
2 2852     Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
2 2853     Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2 2854     Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2 2855     Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
2 2856     But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2 2857     For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
2 2858     Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
2 2859     To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2 2860     Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
2 2861     With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2 2862     Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2 2863     Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
2 2864     And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2 2865     Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
2 2866     Romeo is coming.
2 2867 
2 2868   Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2 2869     To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
2 2870     My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2 2871 
2 2872   Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2 2873 
2 2874   Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
2 2875     Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.
2 2876 
2 2877   Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
2 2878 
2 2879   Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2 2880     Either be gone before the watch be set,
2 2881     Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
2 2882     Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
2 2883     And he shall signify from time to time
2 2884     Every good hap to you that chances here.
2 2885     Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
2 2886 
2 2887   Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2 2888     It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
2 2889     Farewell.
2 2890                                                          Exeunt.

2 2895 Scene IV.
2 2896 Capulet's house
2 2897 
2 2898 Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
2 2899 
2 2900 
2 2901   Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
2 2902     That we have had no time to move our daughter.
2 2903     Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2 2904     And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
2 2905     'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
2 2906     I promise you, but for your company,
2 2907     I would have been abed an hour ago.
2 2908 
2 2909   Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
2 2910     Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
2 2911 
2 2912   Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2 2913     To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
2 2914 
2 2915   Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2 2916     Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
2 2917     In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
2 2918     Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2 2919     Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
2 2920     And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
2 2921     But, soft! what day is this?
2 2922 
2 2923   Par. Monday, my lord.
2 2924 
2 2925   Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
2 2926     Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
2 2927     She shall be married to this noble earl.
2 2928     Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
2 2929     We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
2 2930     For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2 2931     It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2 2932     Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
2 2933     Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2 2934     And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2 2935 
2 2936   Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2 2937 
2 2938   Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
2 2939     Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
2 2940     Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
2 2941     Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
2 2942     Afore me, It is so very very late
2 2943     That we may call it early by-and-by.
2 2944     Good night.
2 2945                                                           Exeunt

2 2950 Scene V.
2 2951 Capulet's orchard.
2 2952 
2 2953 Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
2 2954 
2 2955 
2 2956   Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
2 2957     It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2 2958     That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
2 2959     Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
2 2960     Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2 2961 
2 2962   Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
2 2963     No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
2 2964     Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
2 2965     Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2 2966     Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2 2967     I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2 2968 
2 2969   Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
2 2970     It is some meteor that the sun exhales
2 2971     To be to thee this night a torchbearer
2 2972     And light thee on the way to Mantua.
2 2973     Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2 2974 
2 2975   Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
2 2976     I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2 2977     I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2 2978     'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2 2979     Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
2 2980     The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
2 2981     I have more care to stay than will to go.
2 2982     Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2 2983     How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
2 2984 
2 2985   Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
2 2986     It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2 2987     Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2 2988     Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2 2989     This doth not so, for she divideth us.
2 2990     Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
2 2991     O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
2 2992     Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2 2993     Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
2 2994     O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
2 2995 
2 2996   Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
2 2997 
2 2998                           Enter Nurse.
2 2999 
2 3000 
2 3001   Nurse. Madam!
2 3002 
2 3003   Jul. Nurse?
2 3004 
2 3005   Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
2 3006     The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2 3007 
2 3008   Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2 3009                                                          [Exit.]
2 3010 
2 3011   Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
2 3012                                                   He goeth down.
2 3013 
2 3014   Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
2 3015     I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2 3016     For in a minute there are many days.
2 3017     O, by this count I shall be much in years
2 3018     Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2 3019 
2 3020   Rom. Farewell!
2 3021     I will omit no opportunity
2 3022     That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2 3023 
2 3024   Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2 3025 
2 3026   Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2 3027     For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2 3028 
2 3029   Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2 3030     Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2 3031     As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
2 3032     Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2 3033 
2 3034   Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
2 3035     Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2 3036 Exit.
2 3037 
2 3038   Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
2 3039     If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
2 3040     That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
2 3041     For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
2 3042     But send him back.
2 3043 
2 3044   Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2 3045 
2 3046   Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
2 3047     Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2 3048     What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2 3049 
2 3050                        Enter Mother.
2 3051 
2 3052 
2 3053   Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
2 3054 
2 3055   Jul. Madam, I am not well.
2 3056 
2 3057   Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2 3058     What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2 3059     An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
2 3060     Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
2 3061     But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2 3062 
2 3063   Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2 3064 
2 3065   Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2 3066     Which you weep for.
2 3067 
2 3068   Jul. Feeling so the loss,
2 3069     I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2 3070 
2 3071   Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
2 3072     As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2 3073 
2 3074   Jul. What villain, madam?
2 3075 
2 3076   Lady. That same villain Romeo.
2 3077 
2 3078   Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
2 3079     God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2 3080     And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2 3081 
2 3082   Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
2 3083 
2 3084   Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
2 3085     Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2 3086 
2 3087   Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
2 3088     Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2 3089     Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2 3090     Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
2 3091     That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
2 3092     And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
2 3093 
2 3094   Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
2 3095     With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
2 3096     Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
2 3097     Madam, if you could find out but a man
2 3098     To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2 3099     That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2 3100     Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2 3101     To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
2 3102     To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
2 3103     Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
2 3104 
2 3105   Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2 3106     But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2 3107 
2 3108   Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
2 3109     What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2 3110 
2 3111   Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2 3112     One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2 3113     Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
2 3114     That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
2 3115 
2 3116   Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
2 3117 
2 3118   Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
2 3119     The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
2 3120     The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2 3121     Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2 3122 
2 3123   Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
2 3124     He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
2 3125     I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
2 3126     Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
2 3127     I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
2 3128     I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
2 3129     It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2 3130     Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2 3131 
2 3132   Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
2 3133     And see how be will take it at your hands.
2 3134 
2 3135                    Enter Capulet and Nurse.
2 3136 
2 3137 
2 3138   Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
2 3139     But for the sunset of my brother's son
2 3140     It rains downright.
2 3141     How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
2 3142     Evermore show'ring? In one little body
2 3143     Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
2 3144     For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2 3145     Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
2 3146     Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
2 3147     Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
2 3148     Without a sudden calm will overset
2 3149     Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
2 3150     Have you delivered to her our decree?
2 3151 
2 3152   Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2 3153     I would the fool were married to her grave!
2 3154 
2 3155   Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2 3156     How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
2 3157     Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
2 3158     Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2 3159     So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2 3160 
2 3161   Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
2 3162     Proud can I never be of what I hate,
2 3163     But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
2 3164 
2 3165   Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
2 3166     'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
2 3167     And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
2 3168     Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
2 3169     But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
2 3170     To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2 3171     Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2 3172     Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
2 3173     You tallow-face!
2 3174 
2 3175   Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2 3176 
2 3177   Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2 3178     Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2 3179 
2 3180   Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2 3181     I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
2 3182     Or never after look me in the face.
2 3183     Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
2 3184     My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2 3185     That God had lent us but this only child;
2 3186     But now I see this one is one too much,
2 3187     And that we have a curse in having her.
2 3188     Out on her, hilding!
2 3189 
2 3190   Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
2 3191     You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2 3192 
2 3193   Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
2 3194     Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
2 3195 
2 3196   Nurse. I speak no treason.
2 3197 
2 3198   Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
2 3199 
2 3200   Nurse. May not one speak?
2 3201 
2 3202   Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
2 3203     Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
2 3204     For here we need it not.
2 3205 
2 3206   Lady. You are too hot.
2 3207 
2 3208   Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
2 3209     At home, abroad, alone, in company,
2 3210     Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
2 3211     To have her match'd; and having now provided
2 3212     A gentleman of princely parentage,
2 3213     Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2 3214     Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2 3215     Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
2 3216     And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2 3217     A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2 3218     To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
2 3219     I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
2 3220     But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
2 3221     Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
2 3222     Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
2 3223     Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2 3224     An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2 3225     An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
2 3226     For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2 3227     Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
2 3228     Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.
2 3229 
2 3230   Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
2 3231     That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2 3232     O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2 3233     Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2 3234     Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
2 3235     In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2 3236 
2 3237   Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
2 3238     Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
2 3239 
2 3240   Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2 3241     My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
2 3242     How shall that faith return again to earth
2 3243     Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2 3244     By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
2 3245     Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2 3246     Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2 3247     What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
2 3248     Some comfort, nurse.
2 3249 
2 3250   Nurse. Faith, here it is.
2 3251     Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
2 3252     That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2 3253     Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2 3254     Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2 3255     I think it best you married with the County.
2 3256     O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2 3257     Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
2 3258     Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2 3259     As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2 3260     I think you are happy in this second match,
2 3261     For it excels your first; or if it did not,
2 3262     Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
2 3263     As living here and you no use of him.
2 3264 
2 3265   Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
2 3266 
2 3267   Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
2 3268 
2 3269   Jul. Amen!
2 3270 
2 3271   Nurse. What?
2 3272 
2 3273   Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
2 3274     Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
2 3275     Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
2 3276     To make confession and to be absolv'd.
2 3277 
2 3278   Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
2 3279 
2 3280   Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
2 3281     Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
2 3282     Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
2 3283     Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
2 3284     So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
2 3285     Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
2 3286     I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
2 3287     If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
2 3288 
2 3289 
2 3290 
2 3291 
2 3292 ACT IV. Scene I.
2 3293 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 3294 
2 3295 Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
2 3296 
2 3297 
2 3298   Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
2 3299 
2 3300   Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
2 3301     And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
2 3302 
2 3303   Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
2 3304     Uneven is the course; I like it not.
2 3305 
2 3306   Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
2 3307     And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
2 3308     For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
2 3309     Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
2 3310     That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
2 3311     And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
2 3312     To stop the inundation of her tears,
2 3313     Which, too much minded by herself alone,
2 3314     May be put from her by society.
2 3315     Now do you know the reason of this haste.
2 3316 
2 3317   Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
2 3318     Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
2 3319 
2 3320                     Enter Juliet.
2 3321 
2 3322 
2 3323   Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
2 3324 
2 3325   Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
2 3326 
2 3327   Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
2 3328 
2 3329   Jul. What must be shall be.
2 3330 
2 3331   Friar. That's a certain text.
2 3332 
2 3333   Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
2 3334 
2 3335   Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
2 3336 
2 3337   Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
2 3338 
2 3339   Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
2 3340 
2 3341   Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
2 3342 
2 3343   Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
2 3344     Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
2 3345 
2 3346   Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
2 3347 
2 3348   Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
2 3349     For it was bad enough before their spite.
2 3350 
2 3351   Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
2 3352 
2 3353   Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
2 3354     And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
2 3355 
2 3356   Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
2 3357 
2 3358   Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
2 3359     Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
2 3360     Or shall I come to you at evening mass
2 3361 
2 3362   Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
2 3363     My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
2 3364 
2 3365   Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
2 3366     Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
2 3367     Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
2 3368 
2 3369   Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
2 3370     Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
2 3371 
2 3372   Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
2 3373     It strains me past the compass of my wits.
2 3374     I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
2 3375     On Thursday next be married to this County.
2 3376 
2 3377   Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
2 3378     Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
2 3379     If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
2 3380     Do thou but call my resolution wise
2 3381     And with this knife I'll help it presently.
2 3382     God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
2 3383     And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
2 3384     Shall be the label to another deed,
2 3385     Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
2 3386     Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
2 3387     Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
2 3388     Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
2 3389     'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
2 3390     Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
2 3391     Which the commission of thy years and art
2 3392     Could to no issue of true honour bring.
2 3393     Be not so long to speak. I long to die
2 3394     If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
2 3395 
2 3396   Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
2 3397     Which craves as desperate an execution
2 3398     As that is desperate which we would prevent.
2 3399     If, rather than to marry County Paris
2 3400     Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
2 3401     Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
2 3402     A thing like death to chide away this shame,
2 3403     That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
2 3404     And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
2 3405 
2 3406   Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
2 3407     From off the battlements of yonder tower,
2 3408     Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
2 3409     Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
2 3410     Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
2 3411     O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
2 3412     With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
2 3413     Or bid me go into a new-made grave
2 3414     And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
2 3415     Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
2 3416     And I will do it without fear or doubt,
2 3417     To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
2 3418 
2 3419   Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
2 3420     To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
2 3421     To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
2 3422     Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
2 3423     Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
2 3424     And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
2 3425     When presently through all thy veins shall run
2 3426     A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
2 3427     Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
2 3428     No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
2 3429     The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
2 3430     To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
2 3431     Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
2 3432     Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
2 3433     Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
2 3434     And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
2 3435     Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
2 3436     And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
2 3437     Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
2 3438     To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
2 3439     Then, as the manner of our country is,
2 3440     In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
2 3441     Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
2 3442     Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
2 3443     In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
2 3444     Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
2 3445     And hither shall he come; and he and I
2 3446     Will watch thy waking, and that very night
2 3447     Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
2 3448     And this shall free thee from this present shame,
2 3449     If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
2 3450     Abate thy valour in the acting it.
2 3451 
2 3452   Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
2 3453 
2 3454   Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
2 3455     In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
2 3456     To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
2 3457 
2 3458   Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
2 3459     Farewell, dear father.
2 3460                                                          Exeunt.
2 3461 
2 3462 
2 3463 
2 3464 
2 3465 Scene II.
2 3466 Capulet's house.
2 3467 
2 3468 Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
2 3469                         two or three.
2 3470 
2 3471 
2 3472   Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
2 3473                                             [Exit a Servingman.]
2 3474     Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
2 3475 
2 3476   Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
2 3477     lick their fingers.
2 3478 
2 3479   Cap. How canst thou try them so?
2 3480 
2 3481   Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
2 3482     fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
2 3483     with me.
2 3484 
2 3485   Cap. Go, begone.
2 3486                                                 Exit Servingman.
2 3487     We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
2 3488     What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
2 3489 
2 3490   Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
2 3491 
2 3492   Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
2 3493     A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
2 3494 
2 3495                         Enter Juliet.
2 3496 
2 3497 
2 3498   Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
2 3499 
2 3500   Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
2 3501 
2 3502   Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
2 3503     Of disobedient opposition
2 3504     To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
2 3505     By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
2 3506     To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
2 3507     Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
2 3508 
2 3509   Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
2 3510     I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
2 3511 
2 3512   Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
2 3513     And gave him what becomed love I might,
2 3514     Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
2 3515 
2 3516   Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
2 3517     This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
2 3518     Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
2 3519     Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
2 3520     All our whole city is much bound to him.
2 3521 
2 3522   Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
2 3523     To help me sort such needful ornaments
2 3524     As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
2 3525 
2 3526   Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
2 3527 
2 3528   Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
2 3529                                         Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
2 3530 
2 3531   Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
2 3532     'Tis now near night.
2 3533 
2 3534   Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
2 3535     And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
2 3536     Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
2 3537     I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
2 3538     I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
2 3539     They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
2 3540     To County Paris, to prepare him up
2 3541     Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
2 3542     Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
2 3543                                                          Exeunt.

2 3547 
2 3548 Scene III.
2 3549 Juliet's chamber.
2 3550 
2 3551 Enter Juliet and Nurse.
2 3552 
2 3553 
2 3554   Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
2 3555     I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
2 3556     For I have need of many orisons
2 3557     To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
2 3558     Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
2 3559 
2 3560                           Enter Mother.
2 3561 
2 3562 
2 3563   Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
2 3564 
2 3565   Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
2 3566     As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
2 3567     So please you, let me now be left alone,
2 3568     And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
2 3569     For I am sure you have your hands full all
2 3570     In this so sudden business.
2 3571 
2 3572   Mother. Good night.
2 3573     Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
2 3574                                       Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
2 3575 
2 3576   Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
2 3577     I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
2 3578     That almost freezes up the heat of life.
2 3579     I'll call them back again to comfort me.
2 3580     Nurse!- What should she do here?
2 3581     My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
2 3582     Come, vial.
2 3583     What if this mixture do not work at all?
2 3584     Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
2 3585     No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
2 3586                                              Lays down a dagger.
2 3587     What if it be a poison which the friar
2 3588     Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
2 3589     Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
2 3590     Because he married me before to Romeo?
2 3591     I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
2 3592     For he hath still been tried a holy man.
2 3593     I will not entertain so bad a thought.
2 3594     How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
2 3595     I wake before the time that Romeo
2 3596     Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
2 3597     Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
2 3598     To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
2 3599     And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
2 3600     Or, if I live, is it not very like
2 3601     The horrible conceit of death and night,
2 3602     Together with the terror of the place-
2 3603     As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
2 3604     Where for this many hundred years the bones
2 3605     Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
2 3606     Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
2 3607     Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
2 3608     At some hours in the night spirits resort-
2 3609     Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
2 3610     So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
2 3611     And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
2 3612     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
2 3613     O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
2 3614     Environed with all these hideous fears,
2 3615     And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
2 3616     And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
2 3617     And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
2 3618     As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
2 3619     O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
2 3620     Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
2 3621     Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
2 3622     Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
2 3623 
2 3624         She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
2 3625

2 3629 Scene IV.
2 3630 Capulet's house.
2 3631 
2 3632 Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
2 3633 
2 3634 
2 3635   Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
2 3636 
2 3637   Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
2 3638 
2 3639                        Enter Old Capulet.
2 3640 
2 3641 
2 3642   Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
2 3643     The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
2 3644     Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
2 3645     Spare not for cost.
2 3646 
2 3647   Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
2 3648     Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
2 3649     For this night's watching.
2 3650 
2 3651   Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
2 3652     All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
2 3653 
2 3654   Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
2 3655     But I will watch you from such watching now.
2 3656                                           Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
2 3657 
2 3658   Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
2 3659 
2 3660 
2 3661   Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
2 3662 
2 3663     What is there? Now, fellow,
2 3664 
2 3665   Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
2 3666 
2 3667   Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
2 3668       logs.
2 3669     Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
2 3670 
2 3671   Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
2 3672     And never trouble Peter for the matter.
2 3673 
2 3674   Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
2 3675     Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
2 3676     The County will be here with music straight,
2 3677     For so he said he would.                         Play music.
2 3678     I hear him near.
2 3679     Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
2 3680 
2 3681                               Enter Nurse.
2 3682     Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
2 3683     I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
2 3684     Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
2 3685     Make haste, I say.
2 3686                                                        [Exeunt.]

2 3691 Scene V.
2 3692 Juliet's chamber.
2 3693 
2 3694 [Enter Nurse.]
2 3695 
2 3696 
2 3697   Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
2 3698     Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
2 3699     Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
2 3700     What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
2 3701     Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
2 3702     The County Paris hath set up his rest
2 3703     That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
2 3704     Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
2 3705     I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
2 3706     Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
2 3707     He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
2 3708                                      [Draws aside the curtains.]
2 3709     What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
2 3710     I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
2 3711     Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
2 3712     O weraday that ever I was born!
2 3713     Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
2 3714 
2 3715                            Enter Mother.
2 3716 
2 3717 
2 3718   Mother. What noise is here?
2 3719 
2 3720   Nurse. O lamentable day!
2 3721 
2 3722   Mother. What is the matter?
2 3723 
2 3724   Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
2 3725 
2 3726   Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
2 3727     Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
2 3728     Help, help! Call help.
2 3729 
2 3730                             Enter Father.
2 3731 
2 3732 
2 3733   Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
2 3734 
2 3735   Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
2 3736 
2 3737   Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
2 3738 
2 3739   Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
2 3740     Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
2 3741     Life and these lips have long been separated.
2 3742     Death lies on her like an untimely frost
2 3743     Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
2 3744 
2 3745   Nurse. O lamentable day!
2 3746 
2 3747   Mother. O woful time!
2 3748 
2 3749   Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
2 3750     Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
2 3751 
2 3752 
2 3753   Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
2 3754 
2 3755 
2 3756   Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
2 3757 
2 3758   Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
2 3759     O son, the night before thy wedding day
2 3760     Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
2 3761     Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
2 3762     Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
2 3763     My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
2 3764     And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
2 3765 
2 3766   Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
2 3767     And doth it give me such a sight as this?
2 3768 
2 3769   Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
2 3770     Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
2 3771     In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
2 3772     But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
2 3773     But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
2 3774     And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
2 3775 
2 3776   Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
2 3777     Most lamentable day, most woful day
2 3778     That ever ever I did yet behold!
2 3779     O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
2 3780     Never was seen so black a day as this.
2 3781     O woful day! O woful day!
2 3782 
2 3783   Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
2 3784     Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
2 3785     By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
2 3786     O love! O life! not life, but love in death
2 3787 
2 3788   Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
2 3789     Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
2 3790     To murther, murther our solemnity?
2 3791     O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
2 3792     Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
2 3793     And with my child my joys are buried!
2 3794 
2 3795   Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
2 3796     In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
2 3797     Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
2 3798     And all the better is it for the maid.
2 3799     Your part in her you could not keep from death,
2 3800     But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
2 3801     The most you sought was her promotion,
2 3802     For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
2 3803     And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
2 3804     Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
2 3805     O, in this love, you love your child so ill
2 3806     That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
2 3807     She's not well married that lives married long,
2 3808     But she's best married that dies married young.
2 3809     Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
2 3810     On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
2 3811     In all her best array bear her to church;
2 3812     For though fond nature bids us all lament,
2 3813     Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
2 3814 
2 3815   Cap. All things that we ordained festival
2 3816     Turn from their office to black funeral-
2 3817     Our instruments to melancholy bells,
2 3818     Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
2 3819     Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
2 3820     Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
2 3821     And all things change them to the contrary.
2 3822 
2 3823   Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
2 3824     And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
2 3825     To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
2 3826     The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
2 3827     Move them no more by crossing their high will.
2 3828                            Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
2 3829   1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
2 3830 
2 3831   Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
2 3832     For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
2 3833   1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
2 3834 
2 3835                          Enter Peter.
2 3836 
2 3837 
2 3838   Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
2 3839     O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
2 3840   1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
2 3841 
2 3842   Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
2 3843     full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
2 3844   1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
2 3845 
2 3846   Pet. You will not then?
2 3847   1. Mus. No.
2 3848 
2 3849   Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
2 3850   1. Mus. What will you give us?
2 3851 
2 3852   Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
2 3853      minstrel.
2 3854   1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
2 3855 
2 3856   Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
2 3857     I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
2 3858     note me?
2 3859   1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
2 3860   2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
2 3861 
2 3862   Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
2 3863     iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
2 3864 
2 3865            'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
2 3866              And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
2 3867            Then music with her silver sound'-
2 3868 
2 3869     Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
2 3870     What say you, Simon Catling?
2 3871   1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
2 3872 
2 3873   Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
2 3874   2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
2 3875 
2 3876   Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
2 3877   3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
2 3878 
2 3879   Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
2 3880     is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
2 3881     gold for sounding.
2 3882 
2 3883            'Then music with her silver sound
2 3884              With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.
2 3885 
2 3886   1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
2 3887   2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
2 3888     mourners, and stay dinner.
2 3889                                                          Exeunt.

2 3894 ACT V. Scene I.
2 3895 Mantua. A street.
2 3896 
2 3897 Enter Romeo.
2 3898 
2 3899 
2 3900   Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
2 3901     My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
2 3902     My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
2 3903     And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
2 3904     Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
2 3905     I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
2 3906     (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
2 3907     And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
2 3908     That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
2 3909     Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
2 3910     When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
2 3911 
2 3912                 Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
2 3913 
2 3914     News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
2 3915     Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
2 3916     How doth my lady? Is my father well?
2 3917     How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
2 3918     For nothing can be ill if she be well.
2 3919 
2 3920   Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
2 3921     Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
2 3922     And her immortal part with angels lives.
2 3923     I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
2 3924     And presently took post to tell it you.
2 3925     O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
2 3926     Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
2 3927 
2 3928   Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
2 3929     Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
2 3930     And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
2 3931 
2 3932   Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
2 3933     Your looks are pale and wild and do import
2 3934     Some misadventure.
2 3935 
2 3936   Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
2 3937     Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
2 3938     Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
2 3939 
2 3940   Man. No, my good lord.
2 3941 
2 3942   Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
2 3943     And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
2 3944                                                Exit [Balthasar].
2 3945     Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
2 3946     Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
2 3947     To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
2 3948     I do remember an apothecary,
2 3949     And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
2 3950     In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
2 3951     Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
2 3952     Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
2 3953     And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
2 3954     An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
2 3955     Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
2 3956     A beggarly account of empty boxes,
2 3957     Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
2 3958     Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
2 3959     Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
2 3960     Noting this penury, to myself I said,
2 3961     'An if a man did need a poison now
2 3962     Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
2 3963     Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
2 3964     O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
2 3965     And this same needy man must sell it me.
2 3966     As I remember, this should be the house.
2 3967     Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
2 3968 
2 3969                         Enter Apothecary.
2 3970 
2 3971 
2 3972   Apoth. Who calls so loud?
2 3973 
2 3974   Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
2 3975     Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
2 3976     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
2 3977     As will disperse itself through all the veins
2 3978     That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
2 3979     And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
2 3980     As violently as hasty powder fir'd
2 3981     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
2 3982 
2 3983   Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
2 3984     Is death to any he that utters them.
2 3985 
2 3986   Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
2 3987     And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
2 3988     Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
2 3989     Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
2 3990     The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
2 3991     The world affords no law to make thee rich;
2 3992     Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
2 3993 
2 3994   Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
2 3995 
2 3996   Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
2 3997 
2 3998   Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
2 3999     And drink it off, and if you had the strength
2 4000     Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
2 4001 
2 4002   Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
2 4003     Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
2 4004     Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
2 4005     I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
2 4006     Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
2 4007     Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
2 4008     To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
2 4009                                                          Exeunt.

2 4014 Scene II.
2 4015 Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
2 4016 
2 4017 Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
2 4018 
2 4019 
2 4020   John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
2 4021 
2 4022                       Enter Friar Laurence.
2 4023 
2 4024 
2 4025   Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
2 4026     Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
2 4027     Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
2 4028 
2 4029   John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
2 4030     One of our order, to associate me
2 4031     Here in this city visiting the sick,
2 4032     And finding him, the searchers of the town,
2 4033     Suspecting that we both were in a house
2 4034     Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
2 4035     Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
2 4036     So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
2 4037 
2 4038   Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
2 4039 
2 4040   John. I could not send it- here it is again-
2 4041     Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
2 4042     So fearful were they of infection.
2 4043 
2 4044   Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
2 4045     The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
2 4046     Of dear import; and the neglecting it
2 4047     May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
2 4048     Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
2 4049     Unto my cell.
2 4050 
2 4051   John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
2 4052 
2 4053   Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
2 4054     Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
2 4055     She will beshrew me much that Romeo
2 4056     Hath had no notice of these accidents;
2 4057     But I will write again to Mantua,
2 4058     And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
2 4059     Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.
2 4060 
2 4061 
2 4062 
2 4063 
2 4064 Scene III.
2 4065 Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
2 4066 
2 4067 Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
2 4068 
2 4069 
2 4070   Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
2 4071     Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
2 4072     Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
2 4073     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
2 4074     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
2 4075     (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
2 4076     But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
2 4077     As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
2 4078     Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
2 4079 
2 4080   Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
2 4081     Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
2 4082 
2 4083   Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
2 4084     (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
2 4085     Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
2 4086     Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
2 4087     The obsequies that I for thee will keep
2 4088     Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
2 4089                                                     Whistle Boy.
2 4090     The boy gives warning something doth approach.
2 4091     What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
2 4092     To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
2 4093     What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
2 4094 
2 4095        Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
2 4096                     and a crow of iron.
2 4097 
2 4098 
2 4099   Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
2 4100     Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
2 4101     See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
2 4102     Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
2 4103     Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
2 4104     And do not interrupt me in my course.
2 4105     Why I descend into this bed of death
2 4106     Is partly to behold my lady's face,
2 4107     But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
2 4108     A precious ring- a ring that I must use
2 4109     In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
2 4110     But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
2 4111     In what I farther shall intend to do,
2 4112     By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
2 4113     And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
2 4114     The time and my intents are savage-wild,
2 4115     More fierce and more inexorable far
2 4116     Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
2 4117 
2 4118   Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
2 4119 
2 4120   Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
2 4121     Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
2 4122 
2 4123   Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
2 4124     His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
2 4125 
2 4126   Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
2 4127     Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
2 4128     Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
2 4129     And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
2 4130                                            Romeo opens the tomb.
2 4131 
2 4132   Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
2 4133     That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
2 4134     It is supposed the fair creature died-
2 4135     And here is come to do some villanous shame
2 4136     To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
2 4137     Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
2 4138     Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
2 4139     Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
2 4140     Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
2 4141 
2 4142   Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
2 4143     Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
2 4144     Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
2 4145     Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
2 4146     But not another sin upon my head
2 4147     By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
2 4148     By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
2 4149     For I come hither arm'd against myself.
2 4150     Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
2 4151     A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
2 4152 
2 4153   Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
2 4154     And apprehend thee for a felon here.
2 4155 
2 4156   Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
2 4157                                                      They fight.
2 4158 
2 4159   Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
2 4160                                             [Exit. Paris falls.]
2 4161 
2 4162   Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
2 4163     Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
2 4164 
2 4165   Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
2 4166     Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
2 4167     What said my man when my betossed soul
2 4168     Did not attend him as we rode? I think
2 4169     He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
2 4170     Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
2 4171     Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
2 4172     To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
2 4173     One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
2 4174     I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
2 4175     A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
2 4176     For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
2 4177     This vault a feasting presence full of light.
2 4178     Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
2 4179                                          [Lays him in the tomb.]
2 4180     How oft when men are at the point of death
2 4181     Have they been merry! which their keepers call
2 4182     A lightning before death. O, how may I
2 4183     Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
2 4184     Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
2 4185     Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
2 4186     Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
2 4187     Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
2 4188     And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
2 4189     Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
2 4190     O, what more favour can I do to thee
2 4191     Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
2 4192     To sunder his that was thine enemy?
2 4193     Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
2 4194     Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
2 4195     That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
2 4196     And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
2 4197     Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
2 4198     For fear of that I still will stay with thee
2 4199     And never from this palace of dim night
2 4200     Depart again. Here, here will I remain
2 4201     With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
2 4202     Will I set up my everlasting rest
2 4203     And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
2 4204     From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
2 4205     Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
2 4206     The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
2 4207     A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
2 4208     Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
2 4209     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
2 4210     The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
2 4211     Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
2 4212     Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
2 4213 
2 4214     Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
2 4215 
2 4216 
2 4217   Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
2 4218     Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
2 4219 
2 4220   Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
2 4221 
2 4222   Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
2 4223     What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
2 4224     To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
2 4225     It burneth in the Capels' monument.
2 4226 
2 4227   Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
2 4228     One that you love.
2 4229 
2 4230   Friar. Who is it?
2 4231 
2 4232   Bal. Romeo.
2 4233 
2 4234   Friar. How long hath he been there?
2 4235 
2 4236   Bal. Full half an hour.
2 4237 
2 4238   Friar. Go with me to the vault.
2 4239 
2 4240   Bal. I dare not, sir.
2 4241     My master knows not but I am gone hence,
2 4242     And fearfully did menace me with death
2 4243     If I did stay to look on his intents.
2 4244 
2 4245   Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
2 4246     O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
2 4247 
2 4248   Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
2 4249     I dreamt my master and another fought,
2 4250     And that my master slew him.
2 4251 
2 4252   Friar. Romeo!
2 4253     Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
2 4254     The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
2 4255     What mean these masterless and gory swords
2 4256     To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
2 4257     Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
2 4258     And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
2 4259     Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
2 4260                                                    Juliet rises.
2 4261 
2 4262   Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
2 4263     I do remember well where I should be,
2 4264     And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
2 4265 
2 4266   Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
2 4267     Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
2 4268     A greater power than we can contradict
2 4269     Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
2 4270     Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
2 4271     And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
2 4272     Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
2 4273     Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
2 4274     Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
2 4275 
2 4276   Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
2 4277                                                    Exit [Friar].
2 4278     What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
2 4279     Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
2 4280     O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
2 4281     To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
2 4282     Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
2 4283     To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
2 4284     Thy lips are warm!
2 4285 
2 4286   Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
2 4287     Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
2 4288                                       [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
2 4289     This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
2 4290                   She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
2 4291 
2 4292                 Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
2 4293 
2 4294 
2 4295   Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
2 4296 
2 4297   Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
2 4298     Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
2 4299                                      [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
2 4300     Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
2 4301     And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
2 4302     Who here hath lain this two days buried.
2 4303     Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
2 4304     Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
2 4305                                    [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
2 4306     We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
2 4307     But the true ground of all these piteous woes
2 4308     We cannot without circumstance descry.
2 4309 
2 4310      Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
2 4311 
2 4312   2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
2 4313 
2 4314   Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
2 4315 
2 4316           Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
2 4317 
2 4318   3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
2 4319     We took this mattock and this spade from him
2 4320     As he was coming from this churchyard side.
2 4321 
2 4322   Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
2 4323 
2 4324               Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
2 4325 
2 4326 
2 4327   Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
2 4328     That calls our person from our morning rest?
2 4329 
2 4330             Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
2 4331 
2 4332 
2 4333   Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
2 4334 
2 4335   Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
2 4336     Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
2 4337     With open outcry, toward our monument.
2 4338 
2 4339   Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
2 4340 
2 4341   Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
2 4342     And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
2 4343     Warm and new kill'd.
2 4344 
2 4345   Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
2 4346 
2 4347   Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
2 4348     With instruments upon them fit to open
2 4349     These dead men's tombs.
2 4350 
2 4351   Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
2 4352     This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
2 4353     Is empty on the back of Montague,
2 4354     And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
2 4355 
2 4356   Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
2 4357     That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
2 4358 
2 4359                Enter Montague [and others].
2 4360 
2 4361 
2 4362   Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
2 4363     To see thy son and heir more early down.
2 4364 
2 4365   Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
2 4366     Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
2 4367     What further woe conspires against mine age?
2 4368 
2 4369   Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
2 4370 
2 4371   Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
2 4372     To press before thy father to a grave?
2 4373 
2 4374   Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
2 4375     Till we can clear these ambiguities
2 4376     And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
2 4377     And then will I be general of your woes
2 4378     And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
2 4379     And let mischance be slave to patience.
2 4380     Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
2 4381 
2 4382   Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
2 4383     Yet most suspected, as the time and place
2 4384     Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
2 4385     And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
2 4386     Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
2 4387 
2 4388   Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
2 4389 
2 4390   Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
2 4391     Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
2 4392     Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
2 4393     And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
2 4394     I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
2 4395     Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
2 4396     Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
2 4397     For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
2 4398     You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
2 4399     Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
2 4400     To County Paris. Then comes she to me
2 4401     And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
2 4402     To rid her from this second marriage,
2 4403     Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
2 4404     Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
2 4405     A sleeping potion; which so took effect
2 4406     As I intended, for it wrought on her
2 4407     The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
2 4408     That he should hither come as this dire night
2 4409     To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
2 4410     Being the time the potion's force should cease.
2 4411     But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
2 4412     Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
2 4413     Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
2 4414     At the prefixed hour of her waking
2 4415     Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
2 4416     Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
2 4417     Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
2 4418     But when I came, some minute ere the time
2 4419     Of her awaking, here untimely lay
2 4420     The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
2 4421     She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
2 4422     And bear this work of heaven with patience;
2 4423     But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
2 4424     And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
2 4425     But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
2 4426     All this I know, and to the marriage
2 4427     Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
2 4428     Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
2 4429     Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
2 4430     Unto the rigour of severest law.
2 4431 
2 4432   Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
2 4433     Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
2 4434 
2 4435   Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
2 4436     And then in post he came from Mantua
2 4437     To this same place, to this same monument.
2 4438     This letter he early bid me give his father,
2 4439     And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
2 4440     If I departed not and left him there.
2 4441 
2 4442   Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
2 4443     Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
2 4444     Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
2 4445 
2 4446   Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
2 4447     And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
2 4448     Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
2 4449     And by-and-by my master drew on him;
2 4450     And then I ran away to call the watch.
2 4451 
2 4452   Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
2 4453     Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
2 4454     And here he writes that he did buy a poison
2 4455     Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
2 4456     Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
2 4457     Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
2 4458     See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
2 4459     That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
2 4460     And I, for winking at you, discords too,
2 4461     Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
2 4462 
2 4463   Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
2 4464     This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
2 4465     Can I demand.
2 4466 
2 4467   Mon. But I can give thee more;
2 4468     For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
2 4469     That whiles Verona by that name is known,
2 4470     There shall no figure at such rate be set
2 4471     As that of true and faithful Juliet.
2 4472 
2 4473   Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
2 4474     Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
2 4475 
2 4476   Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
2 4477     The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
2 4478     Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
2 4479     Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
2 4480     For never was a story of more woe
2 4481     Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
2 4482                                                    Exeunt omnes.

2 4538 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4539 electronic works
2 4540 
2 4541 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4542 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
2 4543 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
2 4544 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
2 4545 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
2 4546 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
2 4547 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
2 4548 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
2 4549 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
2 4550 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
2 4551 
2 4552 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
2 4553 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
2 4554 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
2 4555 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
2 4556 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
2 4557 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
2 4558 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
2 4559 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
2 4560 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
2 4561 
2 4562 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
2 4563 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
2 4564 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
2 4565 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
2 4566 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
2 4567 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
2 4568 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
2 4569 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
2 4570 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
2 4571 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
2 4572 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
2 4573 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
2 4574 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
2 4575 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
2 4576 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
2 4577 
2 4578 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
2 4579 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
2 4580 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
2 4581 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
2 4582 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
2 4583 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
2 4584 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
2 4585 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
2 4586 States.

2 4590 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
2 4591 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

2 4593 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
2 4594 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
2 4595 copied or distributed:

2 4604 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
2 4605 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
2 4606 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
2 4607 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
2 4608 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
2 4609 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

2 4631 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
2 4632 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
2 4633 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
2 4634 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
2 4635 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
2 4636 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
2 4637 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
2 4638 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other

2 4645 
2 4646 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
2 4647 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
2 4648 that
2 4649 
2 4650 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
2 4651      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
2 4652      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
2 4653      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
2 4654      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
2 4655      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
2 4656      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
2 4657      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
2 4658      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

2 4664      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
2 4665      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4666      License.  You must require such a user to return or
2 4667      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

2 4674      of receipt of the work.
2 4675 
2 4676 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
2 4677      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
2 4678

2 4685 
2 4686 1.F.
2 4687 
2 4688 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
2 4689 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
2 4690 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4691 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
2 4692 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
2 4693 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
2 4694 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
2 4695 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
2 4696 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
2 4697 your equipment.

2 4699 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
2 4700 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

2 4703 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
2 4704 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
2 4705 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
2 4706 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

2 4708 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
2 4709 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

2 4713 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
2 4714 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
2 4715 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
2 4716 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
2 4717 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
2 4718 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
2 4719 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
2 4720 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
2 4721 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
2 4722 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
2 4723 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
2 4724 opportunities to fix the problem.
2 4725 
2 4726 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
2 4727 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

2 4751 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4752 
2 4753 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
2 4754 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
2 4755 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
2 4756 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
2 4757 people in all walks of life.
2 4758 
2 4759 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
2 4760 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
2 4761 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
2 4762 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
2 4763 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
2 4764 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

2 4796 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
2 4797 Literary Archive Foundation
2 4798 
2 4799 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
2 4800 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
2 4801 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
2 4802 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
2 4803 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
2 4804 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
2 4805 status with the IRS.
2 4806 
2 4807 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
2 4808 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
2 4809 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
2 4810 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
2 4811 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
2 4812 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
2 4813 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
2 4814 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
2 4815 
2 4816 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
2 4817 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
2 4818 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
2 4819 approach us with offers to donate.
2 4820 
2 4821 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
2 4822 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
2 4823 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
2 4824 
2 4825 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
2 4826 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
2 4827 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

2 4831 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
2 4832 works.
2 4833 
2 4834 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4835 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
2 4836 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
2 4837 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
2 4838 
2 4839 
2 4840 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
2 4841 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
2 4842 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
2 4843 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
